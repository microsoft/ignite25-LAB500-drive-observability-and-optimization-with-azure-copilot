These instructions are for participants of Lab500: Drive observability & optimization with Azure Copilot at Microsoft Ignite 2025. 

## Lab Overview

In this hands-on workshop, you’ll learn to 
* Detect and troubleshoot critical app failures using unified observability.
* Improve monitoring posture with Service Groups.
* Understand your optimization posture with cost, carbon footprint, and optimization recommendations.
* Deep dive into your cloud resources' carbon footprint and identify drivers.
* Optimize cost and carbon footprint using the agentic optimization capabilities in Azure Copilot.

**Personas:** Ops Engineer, FinOps Manager, Sustainability Lead, CloudOps Engineer, Application Owner

**Lab Agenda:**

1. Investigate and troubleshoot issues → "Your app is failing-find out why?"
2. Optimize cost & sustainability → "Now that it's stable, how do we optimize cost and carbon footprint?"
3. Automate advanced actions. → "Finally, let's go deeper: agentic rightsizing."
